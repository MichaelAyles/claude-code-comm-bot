# Discord Bot Setup - Complete Idiot's Guide ü§ñ

This guide assumes you know absolutely nothing about Discord bots. Follow every step exactly.

## Part 1: Create the Bot on Discord's Website

### Step 1: Go to Discord Developer Portal
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: https://discord.com/developers/applications
3. **Sign in with your Discord account** (the same one you use for Discord chat)

### Step 2: Create a New Application
1. Click the big blue **"New Application"** button (top right)
2. **Type a name** for your bot (e.g., "Claude Helper Bot")
3. Click **"Create"**
4. You'll see a page with your app details

### Step 3: Create the Bot
1. On the left side, click **"Bot"**
2. Click **"Add Bot"** button
3. Click **"Yes, do it!"** when it asks if you're sure
4. You now have a bot! üéâ

### Step 4: Get Your Bot Token (SUPER IMPORTANT)
1. Under the "Token" section, click **"Reset Token"**
2. Click **"Yes, do it!"** 
3. **COPY THE TOKEN** that appears (it looks like: `MTxxxxx.xxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)
4. **‚ö†Ô∏è SAVE THIS TOKEN SOMEWHERE SAFE** - you'll need it later
5. **‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER SHARE THIS TOKEN** - it's like a password for your bot

### Step 5: Enable Required Permissions
Still on the Bot page:
1. Scroll down to **"Privileged Gateway Intents"**
2. **Turn ON** these switches:
   - ‚òëÔ∏è **Message Content Intent** (THIS IS CRITICAL!)
   - ‚òëÔ∏è **Server Members Intent** (recommended)
3. Click **"Save Changes"** at the bottom

## Part 2: Invite Your Bot to Your Discord Server

### Step 6: Generate Invite Link
1. On the left side, click **"OAuth2"**
2. Then click **"URL Generator"** underneath it
3. Under **"Scopes"**, check the box for:
   - ‚òëÔ∏è **bot**
4. Under **"Bot Permissions"**, check these boxes:
   - ‚òëÔ∏è **View Channels**
   - ‚òëÔ∏è **Send Messages**
   - ‚òëÔ∏è **Read Message History**
   - ‚òëÔ∏è **Use Slash Commands** (optional but good to have)
5. **Copy the URL** that appears at the bottom

### Step 7: Actually Invite the Bot
1. **Paste the URL** in a new browser tab and press Enter
2. **Select your Discord server** from the dropdown
   - If you don't see your server, you don't have admin permissions on any servers
   - You need to either:
     - Create your own server (click + in Discord ‚Üí Create My Own)
     - Ask a server admin to do this for you
3. Click **"Authorize"**
4. Complete any captcha if it appears
5. **Success!** Your bot should now appear in your server's member list (it will be offline until you start it)

## Part 3: Get Your Channel ID

### Step 8: Enable Developer Mode in Discord
1. **Open Discord** (the app or website)
2. Click the **‚öôÔ∏è gear icon** (User Settings) next to your name
3. On the left, scroll down and click **"Advanced"**
4. **Turn ON** the switch for **"Developer Mode"**
5. Click the **X** to close settings

### Step 9: Get the Channel ID
1. **Go to the channel** where you want your bot to send messages
2. **Right-click on the channel name** (in the channel list on the left)
3. Click **"Copy Channel ID"** at the bottom of the menu
4. **Save this number** - it looks like: `123456789012345678`

## Part 4: Put Everything in Your .env File

### Step 10: Update Your .env File
Open your `.env` file and make it look like this:

```env
# Discord Configuration
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=MTxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=123456789012345678

# Telegram Configuration (leave empty if not using)
# TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=
# TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=

# General Configuration
LOG_LEVEL=info
PORT=3000
```

**Replace:**
- `MTxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` with YOUR actual bot token from Step 4
- `123456789012345678` with YOUR actual channel ID from Step 9

### Step 11: Save and Test
1. **Save the .env file**
2. In your terminal, run: `npm start`
3. You should see:
   ```
   Discord bot logged in as YourBotName#1234
   Discord platform initialized successfully
   MCP Server started successfully
   ```
4. **Check Discord** - your bot should now show as "Online" (green dot)

## Troubleshooting

### "Used disallowed intents"
- Go back to Step 5 and make sure **Message Content Intent** is turned ON

### "Invalid Token"
- Go back to Step 4 and get a fresh token
- Make sure there are no extra spaces in your .env file

### "Channel not found"
- Go back to Step 9 and get the channel ID again
- Make sure your bot has access to that channel

### Bot shows offline
- Check your bot token is correct
- Make sure you saved the .env file
- Restart the npm start command

### "Missing Permissions"
- Go back to Step 6 and make sure you selected the right permissions
- You might need to kick and re-invite the bot with the new permissions

## You're Done! üéâ

Your Discord bot is now set up and ready to receive messages from Claude Code. When Claude Code uses the communication tools, messages will appear in your chosen Discord channel.

**What's Next:**
- Start using Claude Code normally
- When you're away from your computer, check Discord for updates
- You can respond to prompts by typing in the Discord channel

**Security Note:**
- Never share your bot token
- Don't commit your .env file to version control
- If you accidentally share your token, go to the Discord Developer Portal and reset it
